Workspace Commands: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmfEKEYdxKU

- We have "default" workspace by default.
- terraform workspace list - shows the list of workspaces.
- terraform workspace new prod - creates a new workspace named "prod"
- terraform workspace new dev- creates a new workspace named "dev"
***This creates specific STATE files for "dev" and "prod" accordingly.***
- terraform workspace show - shows the current workspace we are working in.
- terraform workspace select prod - allows to move to "prod" workspace.

We can create 2 different var files for Dev and Prod and use it with the script.
- dev.tfvars and prod.tfvars
----terraform apply -var-file dev.tfvars
----terraform apply -var-file prod.tfvars
